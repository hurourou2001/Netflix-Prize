Netflix Movies Rating Predictions
Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict user ratings for movies using the Netflix Prize dataset. By tackling challenges like data sparsity and scalability, the project aims to provide a robust recommendation system with high prediction accuracy and ranking precision.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling sparsity and extracting meaningful features from the Netflix Prize dataset.
Implemented Models:
Matrix Factorization Techniques: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR): Addressing the cold-start problem and improving ranking metrics.
XGBoost: The best-performing model, leveraging structured feature engineering for accurate predictions.
Evaluation Metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Precision@10 for ranking precision.
Results

Best Model: XGBoost demonstrated the lowest RMSE 0.86 in test dataset and high ranking precision, outperforming other approaches.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identified key drivers of model performance, such as MovieMeanRating and UserMeanRating.
Error Analysis: Visualized prediction errors using concentration plots, confirming strong overall performance.
